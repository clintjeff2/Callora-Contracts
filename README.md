# Callora Contracts

Soroban smart contracts for the Callora API marketplace: prepaid vault (USDC) and balance deduction for pay-per-call.

## Tech stack

- **Rust** with **Soroban SDK** (Stellar)
- Contract compiles to WebAssembly and deploys to Stellar/Soroban

## What’s included

- **`callora-vault`** contract:
  - `init(owner, initial_balance, min_deposit)` — initialize vault for an owner; optional minimum deposit (0 = none)
  - `get_meta()` — owner, current balance, and min_deposit
  - `deposit(amount)` — increase balance (panics if amount < min_deposit)
  - `deduct(caller, amount, request_id)` — decrease balance (e.g. per API call)
  - `batch_deduct(caller, items)` — multiple deducts in one transaction (reverts entire batch if any would exceed balance)
  - `withdraw(amount)` — owner-only; decreases balance (USDC transfer when integrated)
  - `withdraw_to(to, amount)` — owner-only; withdraw to a designated address
  - `balance()` — current balance

Events are emitted for init, deposit, deduct, withdraw, and withdraw_to. See [EVENT_SCHEMA.md](EVENT_SCHEMA.md) for indexer/frontend use. Approximate gas/cost notes: [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md). Upgrade and migration: [UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md).

## Local setup

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable)
   - [Stellar Soroban CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup) (`cargo install soroban-cli`)

2. **Build and test:**

   ```bash
   cd callora-contracts
   cargo build
   cargo test
   ```

3. **Build WASM (for deployment):**

   ```bash
   cd contracts/vault
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

   Or use `soroban contract build` if you use the Soroban CLI workflow.

## Development

Use one branch per issue or feature (e.g. `test/minimum-deposit-rejected`, `docs/vault-gas-notes`) to keep PRs small and reduce merge conflicts. Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` before pushing.

```

## Deployment

Use Soroban CLI or Stellar Laboratory to deploy the built WASM to testnet/mainnet and configure the vault (owner, optional initial balance). The backend will call `deduct` after metering API usage.
